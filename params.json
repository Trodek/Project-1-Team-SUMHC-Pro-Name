You control a cyborg and fight an alien race through seven different levels with increased difficulty in each one. at the end of each level you must defeat a boss to continiue to the next one.\r\n\r\nOut Zone is a never-ending loop game. This means you can play from the first to the last level and if you finish the last one, the game will continue with the first level again (with an increased difficulty).\r\n\r\nIn this tribute, we will reproduce the stage 4 of the game.\r\n\r\n### Team Members\r\nAdrià Martín: Art and Design\r\nSergi Pérez: QA\r\nIban Mas: Manager\r\nOriol Rodríguez: Code\r\n\r\n### Gameplay Video\r\nComing Soon!\r\n\r\n### Last Release\r\nYou can download the last release of the game [here](https://github.com/Trodek/Project-1-Team-SUMHC-Pro-Name/releases).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
